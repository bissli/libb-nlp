Thanks, Ray. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our results. Let me begin by thanking the employees across Winnebago Industries and our portfolio of outdoor recreation brands for their hard work and resilience throughout the year. Although a difficult retail environment made fiscal 2024 a challenging year for the RV and Marine industries, the collaborative culture and commitment to excellence at Grand Design, Winnebago Newmar, Barletta, Chris-Craft and Lithionics, all serve as the foundation for a return to growth as market conditions improve in the future. Before we get into the details of our Q4 and full year results, there are several key messages I want to convey on this morning's call. First, while the retail environment remains challenging in the short term, we anticipate gradual market improvement over the next 12 to 15 months. We would expect this to occur more materially as we move into the second quarter of calendar 2025, our third fiscal quarter, factoring in the projected easing of interest rates and decreased inventory levels in the Motorhome RV category. Second, we have made substantive leadership changes at Winnebago Motorhome and Winnebago Towables to remedy the operational and financial challenges that have affected the performance of those businesses in recent quarters. Third, we are delighted by the enthusiastic consumer and dealer response to the Lineage Series M Grand Design's inaugural entry in the Motorhome RV segment. The new vehicle was featured at last month's Hershey RV show and RV dealer Open House, and a small number of units began shipping in Q4. The Grand Design team, with support from the businesses across our portfolio, have created an RV with benefits that we believe set a new standard for excellence in a Class C coach. And finally, today we are providing annual financial guidance for the first time. In light of the continued market uncertainty, we are being appropriately cautious out of the gate, but at the midpoint we are forecasting modest improvement on the top line and adjusted EPS growth of 10% compared to prior year. There are several positive takeaways from the quarter worth noting, including initial shipments of Lineage Series M. While not a meaningful contributor in Q4, we expect Lineage to gain momentum as production ramps in the first half of fiscal 2025. In our Marine segment, Barletta continued to take market share in the US aluminum pontoon market. In addition, August marked the fifth consecutive month of year-over-year retail growth for Chris-Craft. On a trailing six-month basis, this iconic brand has grown its retail volume by 32% compared with the same period in fiscal '23. Driven in part by its new launch 27, Chris-Craft's retail share in the 20 to 40 foot fiberglass market has increased in the most recent three, six and 12-month periods as well. Despite the weak retail market environment, our strong balance sheet and positive free cash flow enable us to maintain a thoughtful and balanced capital allocation approach. In Q4, we generated free cash flow of $30 million and returned to combine $19 million to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments, underscoring our confidence in Winnebago Industries long-term growth prospects. Turning to slide five. The RV industry association now estimates calendar 2024 wholesale shipments at a median of about 324,000 units, and we are aligned with that projection. We anchor calendar year 2025 RV industry shipments in the range of 320,000 to 350,000 units. Wholesale total RV industry shipments were up 10% year-over-year for the month of August and up 14.5% year-to-date through the first eight months of calendar '24. This reflects continued progress towards right sizing inventory and in addressing the growing consumer demand for affordability. The Motorhome portion of the industry remains in destocking mode, with wholesale shipments down 31% year-over-year in August and down 24.2% year-to-date. Within our universe of RV dealers, inventory turns were down very slightly in the fourth quarter compared with the year earlier period. Inventory for Winnebago Industries was down 4.5% from Q4 of fiscal '23, which underscores our focus on continuing to aggressively manage production amidst what remains a challenging macroeconomic environment. Turning to slide six. For the trailing 12 months ended August 31, our total market share was 11.1%, down 50 basis points from the same period in '23. As I noted on our Q3 call, we have introduced new products over the past two quarters that we believe will contribute to stabilizing our market share in the coming months. We believe this deliberate approach is crucial for fostering strong long-term relationships with our dealer partners. As a result, we were pleased to see positive share gains for our Winnebago brand Class C Motorhome and Newmar's full motorized product lines, both of which showed year-over-year growth across the trailing three, six and 12-month periods through the end of August. Slide seven showcases Barletta's continued momentum in the Marine segment. For the trailing 12 months through August 2024, Barletta's market share increased 200 basis points year-over-year to 9.1%. Our premium pontoons consistently outperform competitors, driving exceptional results for our dealer network and elevating the customer experience. Turning to recent highlights on slide eight. During the quarter, we made some strategic changes to our executive team and the leadership in our Winnebago Motorhome and Winnebago Towables businesses. Chris West, who previously served as Senior Vice President of Enterprise Ops and Barletta Boats, was named President of our Winnebago branded Motorhome and Specialty Vehicles business. Chris, an eight-year veteran of Winnebago Industries, in addition to previous oversight responsibilities of the Enterprise's manufacturing and supply chain operations, also successfully led the integration of Barletta and played a vital role in the boat brand's achievement of double-digit market share growth. His broad experience will be invaluable as we further enhance the Winnebago brand's influence, impact and market share. Our Winnebago branded Towables business has underperformed our expectations and it is imperative that we have two strong Towables brands to compete successfully in the marketplace. To enable the Winnebago branded Towables business to reach its full potential, Don Clark has been promoted to Group President of our Towables business. Effective November 1, Don will expand his responsibilities to oversee Winnebago Towables in addition to his role as President of Grand Design RV. This change centralizes our Towables expertise in Indiana. His insights, operational acumen and extensive knowledge of what it takes to win in the space will make Don the ideal and logical choice to lead the team during their next evolution. Both Chris and Don will continue to report to me. These changes are designed to bolster our position as the trusted leader in the premium outdoor recreation market and drive our next phase of growth. Turning to our product innovations, I am excited to highlight our bold and innovative model year 2025 lineup, much of which we recently showcased at the Hershey RV show. Across our Winnebago Grand Design and Newmar brands, we introduced nearly 150 new models and floor plans, demonstrating our commitment to technology, design and comfort. As expected, one of the highlights of the Hershey show was the Class C Lineage Series M Grand Design's first ever motorhome model. From its thoughtfully designed interior to its superior payload capacity and driving performance, Lineage more than lives up to the high expectations and exacting standards of our loyal Grand Design customers. These product innovations across our portfolio of premium brands underscore our dedication to elevating every moment outdoors for our customers. Now let me turn the call over to Bryan for the financial review.
