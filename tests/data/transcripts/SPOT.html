   So moving to our performance. We had a strong quarter and closed out 2024 even better than we anticipated. This gives us plenty of runway and flexibility for years to come. It was our highest Q4 ever for MAU additions and our second-highest of all time. We also had record-high subscriber additions, but that's not all. We set quarterly record highs for revenue, gross margin, operating income, and free cash flow as we closed out our first full year of profitability. So what drove this growth? Well, in large part, it's the result of countless improvements and tweaks we made over the past two years and continuous system of innovation that has brought us to where we are today. And we also introduced new efforts and tools to help video creators turn their shows into a sustainable business. And in just the first couple of months actually, more than 70% of eligible significant driver of our business. This year, over 245 million users engaged with Wrapped,

   In Q4, we enhanced our product in areas like video and audiobooks with many more innovations to come in the quarters ahead. And it's really this ongoing commitment to incremental progress that ultimately adds up to something massive over the long term, even if the exact timing sometimes is hard to predict. Gustav, do you want to share a few thoughts on how we innovated the product given how consequential it's been for our growth?

   Sure. Thanks, Daniel. So as you shared, we made some exciting updates this quarter, including launching our new video proposition at scale. But beyond the work itself, I also want to commend the team for how quickly we got it done. For example, when we saw higher engagement happening on video podcasts and received feedback from creators that they were looking for new monetization opportunities, we moved really fast to launch our new Spotify partner program and video podcast experience.

   Great. Well, okay. Thanks, Gustav. Another huge driver behind our MAU and subscriber growth was our annual wrapped campaign, which celebrated 10 years. Wrapped is always a big contributor to our Q4 performance and this year was no exception. Alex, perhaps you want to share a bit more light on what happened in the campaign.

We did change up the experience a bit and despite the massive success in the engagement, we heard from a few users that they wanted to see more -- even more creativity. So look for more surprises from us in our 2025 experience. But overall, a really big win as evidenced in our numbers.

  <p block-type="Text">
   All right. Thanks, Alex. So as you can see, many of the things we put in play are working very, very well. And 2024 was a year where we really showed what we're capable of. And I'm sure you must be asking, if 2024 was the year of monetization, how will we define 2025? Well, I'm still working it through, I am coining this year the year of accelerated execution. So what does this look like in practice? Well, I think it will require three things. First, we need to move even faster to ship improvements. The landscape is shifting constantly and I want to set the pace, not play, follow the leader. We're also going all-in on our core and investing in more music experiences on the platform. Think video, think the higher priced premium tier that we've discussed previously, and new ways to bring fans and artists closer together, features and offers that will all continue to push the historic expansion we're seeing in the music industry. And finally, we must also remain disciplined with our resources as we aggressively pursue these opportunities. always a little overhang that we see in this quarter, a quarter that historically looks different than the rest of the year. And while we don't share an annual forecast, I couldn't be more confident in profitability. And we're doing all of this while we continue to learn and optimize investing for the long-term to benefit of artists, creators, and our users. finishing at 263 million. This represented our best quarter four for MAU net additions, while the net additions for subscriber matched the peak performance we delivered five years ago. Total neutral growth of 6%, reflecting market spending and brand-related campaigns. We also saw some early positive progress in our automated sales efforts. Moving to profitability, gross margin came in at a record 32.2%, surpassing guidance by income of EUR477 million was aided by gross profit strength. Operating income was impacted by Finally, free cash flow was record EUR877 million in the quarter.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Thanks, Daniel, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Let me give you some color on the quarter four results and then some perspective on our outlook. Our quarter four was exceptionally strong. MAU grew by 35 million to 675 million in total. We added 11 million net subscribers, revenue was EUR4.2 billion and grew 17% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Premium revenue rose 19% year-on-year on a constant currency basis, driven by continued subscriber growth and ARPU growth associated with price increases. Our advertising business saw currency
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   approximately 40 basis points, primarily due to content cost favorability. For the full year, gross margin came in at 30.1%, representing 450 basis points of improvement relative to the full year 2023. This was our largest rate of gross margin expansion as a public company. Operating EUR96 million in social charges in the quarter, which were EUR80 million higher than our forecast. As a reminder, we don't forecast share price movements in our outlook for the business since they are outside of control.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   the year with EUR7.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. So looking ahead to guidance, as many of you know, we are entering a seasonally smallest quarter in terms of MAU and subscriber intake as well as ad sales. As a result, in quarter one, we are forecasting 678 million MAU, an increase of 3 million from quarter four, and 265 million subscribers, an increase of 2 million over quarter four. We're also forecasting EUR4.2 billion in total revenue. We anticipate a gross margin of 31.5% and an operating income of EUR548 million.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   With respect to the MAU net additions, we had an exceptionally strong quarter four with outperformance driven by developing markets, and we are not prioritizing retention of the recent influx of lower engagement users in quarter one as we continue to focus on growing higher value users. While this will amplify typical quarter-one seasonality, for the coming quarters we remain confident in our product and marketing strategies and we expect full-year 2025 net additions to be within the range of the last four years. We respect to -- with respect to subscriber net additions, we expect another year of healthy growth with a focus on customer quality and improving LTVs. While we do not give full-year guidance for gross margin and operating margin, we are expecting both to improve in 2025 on a full-year basis, albeit at a more moderated pace relative to last year's exceptional levels. As Daniel alluded to earlier, we plan to make targeted investments in our core offerings, which may make our sequential gross margin cadence a bit more variable over the course of this year. That said, our fourth quarter gross margin is expected to be higher than the quarter one due to seasonality. Finally, we expect our free cash flow generation to meaningfully exceed what we generated in 2024. On capital allocation having just generated our first year of profitability, we're very pleased with the recent inflection in our liquidity profile and emerging optionality this provides. prioritizing the business first. To the extent capacity rises, we will, of course, take our shareholders growth and continued improvements in profitability, while remaining disciplined with our respect to how people vote up their preference for questions. And today's first question is going about efficiency, 2024 was monetization. Daniel, do you want to elaborate more on '25?
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Sustainable growth opportunities with attractive return potential remains our top priority. We are into consideration. In conclusion and echoing Daniel's remarks, in 2025, we expect healthy resources.

   With that, I hand things back to you Bryan for Q&amp;A.

   Yeah, sure. I did touch on this in my opening remarks, but we're -- I'm coining this year the year of accelerated execution. And basically what that should mean for investors is we think we can pick up the pace dramatically when it comes to our product velocity. We're going to double down on music and we're going to be very disciplined while doing it.

So we look at 2025 as the year where we'll double down on music and we're very excited about what will come. And side, but we're very excited about it. But maybe as a general up leveling to this, if you think about sort of the history of where we've been as a company, most of what we tried to do in the early days was really getting people from piracy into a legal music environment. And to do that, we needed a very, very simple proposition. And that simple proposition was our freemium model. You could start using Spotify for free, try it out and if you like the product and you were using it, we added a lot of benefits for you to become a paying premium subscriber. And a lot of our consumers ended up doing that. different subgroups. One of them we've been talking about, which is the super fans.

   Over time then, we added a few other modes for you to pay for Spotify, like the family plan, like duo, like student plans, just to name a few that's been driving growth.

   growth remains disappointing, while you're embracing programmatic, there seems to be a disconnect given the size and engagement of your audience and your rather lackluster advertising revenues. Can you help us understand why brands are not dying to be on Spotify given the momentum?

   A - Christian Luiga

  <p block-type="Text">
   Thank you, Richard. Yeah, I first start out to say, yeah, we moved from brand sales into performance sales. It is clearly something that we recognized last year, we were late on the ball. So that is nothing to be sort of hiding away from. But from that, we actually made a decision then to move into programmatic and that takes a little bit time, but we are on the ball now. We have supply on our server, opening up for more demand on the bidding. As you know, we have started out now at Trade Desk and we're going to look to add more partners onto our platform. And as I said last quarter, yes, this is a little bit late, but we have a stable transition and this year 2025 will be the year of building and 2026 when we think we're going to get scale.

   Thanks for the question, Justin. This is Alex Norstrom here. The way we think about ARPU growth going forward is, that it's a function between really three things. It's price adjustments, future tiering and then also selling add-ons to our existing subscribers. And with respect to price great care in the steps to balance the value-to-price ratio. Over time, this is something we've mentioned before as well. And when it comes to value, the way we do it is, we add value by way of features and content experiences.

And we've continuously just increased the size of the number of audiobooks we have. We have 350,000 audiobooks now in 10 markets. We have 67 million video podcasts. We pretty much have the world's entire catalog of music. And then as far as price goes, we adjust price where it makes sense. And then our subscribers reward us with more love, more engagement, and sticking around. And so really the key takeaway here is that we believe Spotify is one of, if not the most loved and highest-value in subscription entertainment.

   Hey, Rich, this is Gustav. I'll take that question. So as you know, we had this event in LA in podcasts are becoming video, this is very important to us. And so we saw this pretty early on and we pivoted our model to build both a better creator experience with the premium payouts, but also importantly a better consumer experience where premium users in these currently four markets receive an experience uninterrupted by ads.

It's very early, but we're very happy with it. And when it comes to engagement, obviously, we always want to maximize engagement across all platforms. As -- I think you know, we invest heavily in ubiquity and that includes TV.

And I'm not going to go into more details on quarter four, but I just want to give you Ben, a little bit on the drivers going forward. We don't give a guidance for the full year, but we do try to make it as easy for you as possible. And that's why in the same time, as we said that we're going to plan to make audiobooks and we're now doing the video and we're saying we're also going to invest in music this year, that will then come through the year. looking for in the business. And finally, I just want to on that also mention that the seasonality will the impact you expect on margins in first quarter from the program and does it ramp from here?

  <p block-type="Text">
   But to give you some kind of -- something to hold on to, we also said that this will be more variable over the course of this year, but in the end of the year, it should be higher than we ended in 2024 for the full year. And the quarter four will also be higher than quarter one. And I think with that, you just -- you can imagine that there will be possibilities for distortion, but it was also that there is an investment that needs to come through this year to drive the growth we are play in as well.

   Yeah. I assume you mean the creators on the video side.

So we feel really good about it. And then as Christian mentioned in the last question, as it pertains to margins, I think his answer, I don't need to regurgitate it. I think it was a pretty solid one, which is, we feel really good about it on the year, but maybe some variability in the quarters.

   I'll take this, Doug. It's Alex again. So if you take a step-back and really think about what we're doing here, it's -- we believe that music is the most beloved art form in and around the world. And if you add to that the video podcasts and then also our recent entering into the books market with audiobooks, we just see this enormous time ahead of us. So there's plenty of headroom for us to grow. The most important thing is that we are relentlessly focused on building this -- what we call the best and most valuable subscriptions offering for paying users around the world.

If you, for instance, take a look at the monthly time spent on Spotify, it's one of the highest compared to any of the top entertainment platforms out there. Our subs just love the wonderful combo of music, video podcast now and audiobooks.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   And it's worth repeating that in Q4, we had 11 million net-adds, which was a record tied with Q4 in 2019 and the growth was really just broad-based across geo product with US and emerging markets leading the outperformance. We even saw some progress for the moment in a day that users use Spotify -- subscribers use Spotify. And one interesting stat is that we're now second only AM and FM radio in the US in cars. So the sub to MAU ratio is roughly 40% now and in more developed markets is 50% or even north of 50% and the bottom-line here is that the funnel is strong around the world.

   Yeah. So again, there's always competitive dynamics. We're obviously operating in a highly competitive marketplace with lots of competitors. That's not news to us.

And we have everything from sort of global tech platforms as competitors to sometimes local regional

   Okay. Next question from Rich Greenfield on education. Can you explain how you're thinking about the education and courses product that initially launched in the UK? What have you content?

   And so what we were specifically referencing in this case was a net positive to Spotify, where one Yeah. So it's really early days when it comes to our educational program, but it's a category that I'm personally quite passionate about. What I can say so far is that we're really pleased with the early developments. There's been millions of subscribers in the UK that have seen educational content. There's been a very strong demand in terms of people trialing out the educational part and even sampling it. So far, very positive early indications. But these are very, very early days. And if you know this company and known us for a while, this is quite oftentimes we do experiment quite a bit in different verticals. addition significantly exceeded your fourth quarter outlook at 11 million and were an acceleration in first quarter of '25 relative to the 3 million you added in the first quarter of '24? And that usually brings a little bit of a hangover into the first quarter, and first quarter also from a

  <p block-type="Text">
   Sometimes we pivot with these learnings, sometimes we double-down and scale. It's a space, however, that is quite exciting and maybe to put that in perspective for investors. So the global entertainment industry is probably somewhere between $2 trillion to $2.5 trillion case. If you look at the global educational marketplace, it's $6 trillion, $6.5 trillion in totality. But if you remove sort of basic education or elementary or K-9 or K-12 education, it's about $2 trillion to $2.5 trillion. So the space of knowledge versus entertainment is an interesting one.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   And if you think about Spotify as a product, one of the most amazing things for us is we're not a pure-play entertainment platform. We are also a platform where people spend a lot of time educating themselves already with podcast, with audiobooks. So education is really a quite natural step and extension into that journey, but it's super early days and you should not be surprised if we keep on experimenting, improving, or pivoting the products that we're putting out in the marketplace.

But with that said, what I'm particularly pleased about in Q4 and maybe even the back half of the year is the development of the emerging markets. We saw it pretty clearly in MAU topline growth. And I think that's due to a lot of the tweaks that the teams have been doing that gets people in the funnel. We're trying to increase engagement. I feel really good about some of the music things we're planning across the year. That will drive even further engagement in those emerging markets. And when we have very strong engagement, it typically then always correlates with strong conversion to subscriber growth. And this has been the case from the early days of Latin America where people were questioning how big that market could be. for both the revenue and profitability for both the company and the music industry holistically. should expect more of the profitability growth to come from developed markets rather than emerging markets.

   And I now think everyone realizes it's a very big market and can be a meaningful additive driver And I certainly believe that will be the case for these emerging markets too. I also want to note that in Q4, we did see a positive trend on subscriber net additions from emerging markets too. So we are making progress on that front, but I think that there's just to set expectations, you be substantial businesses to Spotify that will deliver.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Great question, Eric. It's really a question of how supply meets demand. And if you think about the advertising market, it's just growing, growing. Some say that it will grow from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in the next decade. I don't know what the number is. It's just clear that it's growing. And on the supply side, if you look at Spotify, we have a pretty distinct and unique inventory of audio engagement, which is very high and so very sticky. And if you think about how we've treated our
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   supply before on the free trails [ph], we've generally just used direct sales to meet this demand. And so the difference now from -- before is that we are going to implement automation and programmatic and the idea with that is simply to just be saying, hey, we're open for business now and we're going to have our supply meet the -- every increasing demand that's out there. And as far as video goes, it's a format that is obviously very potent and very attractive. And the more video inventory grows, the more supply we will have and the more demand we'll be able to meet? Well, I'm not going to go into details on the UMG part. But first of all, quarter one, I think the main podcast is breakeven on gross profit, how should we be thinking about podcast expense profitability in podcast, but we also do the investments now going forward into video. So you skippable podcast ads for premium users, including the relative trade-offs between the user November. And the way to think about it is that for videos, we are now offering precisely this. We are offering a podcast -- video podcast without dynamic ad interruptions. And as you say, what podcast yet. For technical reasons, they work differently, the ad stacks, there is something called

  </p>
  <h4>
   A - Christian Luiga
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   driver in quarter one is seasonality. Ad sales is usually weaker and it is a weaker quarter. And therefore, the gross margin will be always a little bit lower in that quarter. But on top of that, we have made several investments in video and others and this, of course, will also impact margin, but without going into any details, that's what I'm going to say.

   A - Gustav Soderstrom {BIO 20561192 &lt;GO&gt;}

  <p block-type="Text">
   Maria, this is Gustav here. I'll answer that. So this is what we announced at the LA event in we had to solve there was the monetization. So we are instead paying out for these video podcasts to these creators, so that they are not making less money, if fact, they're making the same or more. So we're doing that for video podcast right now, we're not doing it for audio dynamic ad insertion in podcast that doesn't really exist in video, et cetera. So we're doing this for video right now. No plans for audio at the moment.

  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Hey, Ben, thanks for the question. I appreciate that. This is Gustav. So quickly how to think about AGI or ASI artificial superintelligence, and Spotify is that AI really drives three areas for us. One is, as for any other tech company, just productivity, both in -- when it comes to writing code, but also in general. And as everyone else, we're very aggressively adopting coding assistance, et cetera, and seeing great productivity increases. So that's one benefit of AI. actually benefit even more from this new generation of AI. But there are also new experiences
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The other one that maybe we haven't talked much about is actually moderation costs. So you've seen Spotify launch comments, for example, on podcast that are very successful for us. We get a lot of people commenting. This is something that we can only do because of AI. Previously, the cost of moderation were just prohibitive for a company like us. So that's been a great boon for us.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   And then the third area is obviously the user experience. Maybe the most obvious thing in the user experience is actually the recommendations, which is one of the biggest impacts. And it's important to know that even though we've been doing recommendations for a long time, they like the AI DJ, AI playlist, et cetera. And we think that we are investing at a prudent level in AI today.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Our next question is from Ben Swinburne. Can you share your perspective on artificial general intelligence and how it might benefit Spotify's business over the long term? Do you need to invest meaningfully to capture this opportunity or has DeepSeek shown the benefits can be And when it comes to DeepSeek, we see this as sort of further evidence that these large AI models and intelligence in general is getting commoditized in open source pretty fast, meaning that the dollar cost of unit per intelligence, if you want to think about it like that, it keeps dropping rapidly and the industry forecasted to drop even more. So we feel we're investing at a prudent level and we'll continue to do that. I look very good at our position right now and our level of spend. the portion of your base, which might pay a premium or a super fans or HiFi tier if you finally

   Hey, Rich, Alex here, it's good to hear from you. As discussed before, price adjustments is now part of our toolkit and so we do it continuously and in markets where we raised prices in this previous quarter in Q4. Our churn was low and really in line with what we've seen with other increases from before. And as far as the super fans and HiFi tier goes, obviously, we do research and primarily we talk to our own users to ask them who is interested in what products and what additions and so on. And I can tell you that as we scale and now we've scaled to 263 million subscribers, there is more and more people that are interested in something like a super premium tier. And as Daniel told you, I'm also super-excited about this product that we're working on, but have nothing more to share from that currently.

And is there flexibility under your agreements with content providers for say a podcast Well, I mean some of this Alex already touched upon that we're sort of moving from this one size fits all to this much more sort of specialized tier as the base of consumers are growing into the hundreds of millions. And so I think that while I can't answer the specifics, what I would say in general is you should expect there to be many more versions of Spotify in the future that will adapt to all the various sub-segments of this now 263 million base -- strong consumer base. And so, yeah, we're very excited about sort of entering into that new era of a more tailored Spotify for your needs. the healthy double-digit growth to continue -- it will continue into (technical difficulty). how might you amend this in 2025?

  <p block-type="Text">
   And why are we doing this? Well, we think that AI presents a great opportunity for products. It's very important for us to always be at the very cutting edge of this. People talk of sort of a product overhang that there's also capability, but no one is building the products yet. We want to be the company that builds those products. We want to be the company that's the best in the world at building AI-based products. This is why you see us innovating and trying these things before

The last two years, Alex and I have been running the company in a fairly unique way, which is very synchronized. We actually don't have our own direct reporting teams. We have a single team together that is called the eTeam [ph], which really represents the people who run Spotify. It's about 15 people. And what we do is we work in increments of six months. Senior people in the company pitch their ideas for the company, something called Bets. for six months on this plan. This has proven to be very efficient for us.

   All right. Well, I'm very, very excited about 2025. And I think you guys and hopefully you feel it too after this Q&amp;A session too, but we feel really good about where we are both as a product and as a business. And we will continue to place bets that will drive long-term impact, increasing our speed while maintaining the levels of efficiency we achieved last year. And I think it's really this combination that will enable us to build the best and most valuable user experience, grow sustainably and deliver creativity to the world. So thanks again for joining everyone. profits,
